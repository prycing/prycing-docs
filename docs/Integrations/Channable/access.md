# Granting Prycing Access to Channable

To help you with troubleshooting and support, we recommend adding our support team as a user in your Channable account. This guide will walk you through the process.

## Prerequisites

- Owner access to your Channable account (only owners can manage users)
- The email address to add: support@prycing.eu

## Steps to Add Prycing Support

1. Log in to your Channable account
2. Click on your account name in the top right corner
3. Select "Users" from the dropdown menu
4. Click the "Invite user" button
5. Enter the following details:
   - Email: support@prycing.eu
   - Role: Select "Owner" for full access (preferred) or "External" if you prefer limited access
   - Name: Prycing Support
6. Click "Send invitation"

The invited user will receive an email with instructions to set up their account.

## Access Levels

- **Owner**: Full access to all features and settings (recommended)
  - Can manage users
  - Can access all account settings
  - Can view and edit all data
- **External**: Limited access to specific features
  - Can only access assigned projects
  - Cannot manage users
  - Limited access to account settings

We recommend granting Owner access to ensure we can provide the best possible support. However, if you prefer to limit access, External access will still allow us to assist with most common issues.

## Managing Access

As an owner, you can:
- View all users and their roles
- Change user roles
- Remove users
- Resend invitations

## Next Steps

Once you've added our support team, we'll be able to:
- Help troubleshoot integration issues
- Assist with data synchronization problems
- Provide guidance on best practices
- Help optimize your Channable setup

If you have any questions about access levels or need assistance, please contact our support team.
